## Micronaut Core:

### Dependency Injection
- Flexible loosely coupled components 
- Easier testing 

**Micronaut Inject**
- Inspired by Spring DI and Google Dagger
- Independent (micronaut-inject-java, micronaut-inject-groovy)

### Design Goals
- Use reflection as last resort
  - instead use annotation processing during compile time
- Optimize start-up time
- Reduce memory footprint 
- Provide clear, understandable error handling
